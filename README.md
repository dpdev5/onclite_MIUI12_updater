I am not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards,
thermonuclear war, or the current economic crisis caused by you following
these directions. YOU are choosing to make these modificiations, and if
you point your finger at me for messing up your device, I will LMAO at you.

If we have downloaded the zip, we extract it and enter the resulting folder, if we have done a clone we don't have to extract anything.

Now we connect the phone in Fastboot mode (press the volume down and power button at the same time until it appears on the Fastboot screen).
